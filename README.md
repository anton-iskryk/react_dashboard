# React dashboard app

## ðŸ”¹About the app:
- The app was created strictly to the design and is compatible only with devices that have a width of 1920px and more. Adaptation on smaller devices can be implemented in further updates.
 - Data for all the blocs was fetched from a backend server with axios library.
 - There are also Login and Register pages in the code. The logic of registration and logging in a user is still in progress.
